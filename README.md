# SpriteSheetSelector
Simple tool for selecting a sprite from constant width/height sprite sheets

### Disclaimer
I was trying hard to find such a tool, but there was none in the whole Internet apparently.
Finally I decided to spent an hour and write it from scratch.

### Usage
What you need is just a modern (CSS3 support) web browser.
Provide URL to sprite sheet.
Click: save ASCII char.
Double click: generate CSS code
